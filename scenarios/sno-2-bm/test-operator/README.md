## Tempest Tests Configuration for Test Operator

The YAML file, `tempest-tests.yml`, is a configuration for running Tempest tests, which is a validation framework for OpenStack. Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

1. **apiVersion, kind, and metadata**: These fields define the API version, kind (type) of resource, and metadata (name and namespace) for the Tempest test job.

2. **spec**: This section contains the configuration for the Tempest test job.

   - **networkAttachments**: This field specifies the network attachment for the test job. In this case, it's set to `ctlplane`.

   - **storageClass**: This field sets the storage class for the test job to `lvms-local-storage`.

   - **privileged**: This field is set to `true`, which means the test containers will have elevated privileges.

   - **workflow**: This section defines the steps to be executed in the test job. There are two steps in this configuration:

     - **ironic-scenario-testing**: This step runs scenario tests for Ironic, the OpenStack bare-metal provisioning service. The `tempestconfRun` section configures Tempest settings for this step, such as disabling isolated networks, setting the number of available nodes, and specifying the compute flavor and hypervisor type. The `tempestRun` section specifies the concurrency level and the list of tests to include and exclude.

     - **ironic-api-testing**: This step runs API tests for Ironic. Similar to the previous step, the `tempestconfRun` section configures Tempest settings, and the `tempestRun` section specifies the concurrency level and the list of tests to include and exclude.

In summary, this YAML file configures a Tempest test job to run two types of tests for Ironic: scenario tests and API tests. The tests are executed with specific configurations and concurrency levels.

## Automation Variables for HotStack Deployment

The `automation-vars.yml` file defines a series of stages for an automated process to set up pre-requisites and execute tests.

Here's a brief overview of each stage:

1. **Apply ironic network-attachement-definition**: Applies a NetworkAttachmentDefinition (NAD) for the Ironic network and waits for it to be ready.
2. **Patch RedFish Sushy Emulator Deployment - add network attachment**: Patches the RedFish Sushy Emulator Deployment to include a network attachment definition and waits for the deployment to be available.
3. **Set a multiattach volume type and create it if needed**: Ensures a multiattach volume type exists in OpenStack and creates one if it doesn't.
4. **Create public network if needed**: Creates a public network in OpenStack if it doesn't already exist.
5. **Create subnet on public network if needed**: Creates a subnet on the public network if it doesn't already exist.
6. **Create private network if needed**: Creates a private network in OpenStack if it doesn't already exist.
7. **Create subnet on private network if needed**: Creates a subnet on the private network if it doesn't already exist.
8. **Create network for ironic provisioning if needed**: Creates a network for Ironic provisioning if it doesn't already exist.
9. **Create subnet for ironic provisioning if needed**: Creates a subnet for Ironic provisioning if it doesn't already exist.
10. **Create baremetal flavor if needed**: Ensures a baremetal flavor exists in OpenStack and creates one if it doesn't.
11. **Copy ironic_nodes.yaml to the openstackclient pod**: Copies the `ironic_nodes.yaml` file to the `openstackclient` pod.
12. **Enroll nodes in ironic**: Enrolls the nodes defined in `ironic_nodes.yaml` into Ironic and waits for them to reach the "enroll" state.
13. **Manage ironic nodes**: Manages the Ironic nodes, setting them to be managed by Ironic, and waits for them to reach the "manageable" state.
14. **Power off the ironic nodes**: Powers off the Ironic nodes.
15. **Set capabilities boot_mode:uefi for ironic nodes**: Sets the boot mode to UEFI for the Ironic nodes and ensures they are powered off.
16. **Ensure ironic nodes are powered off**: Ensures the Ironic nodes are powered off.
17. **Provide ironic nodes**: Provides the Ironic nodes, making them available for provisioning, and waits for them to reach the "available" state.
18. **Wait for ironic nodes to get to state - available**: Waits for the provided nodes to reach the "available" state.
19. **Wait for expected compute services (OSPRH-10942)**: Waits for the expected number of compute services to be available.
20. **Run nova-manage discover_hosts and wait for host records (OSPRH-10942)**: Runs `nova-manage discover_hosts` and waits for the expected number of host records to be created.
21. **Run tempest**: Runs the Tempest testing framework utilising test-operator (github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/test-operators)
